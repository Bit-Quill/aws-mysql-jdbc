/**
 * Collect certain performance metrics for ClusterAwareConnectionProxy.
 *
 * <p>Performance (duration in time) metrics: - Failover Detection Duration of time between a start
 * of executing sql statement to the moment when driver identifies a communication error and starts
 * a failover process (a process to re-connect to another cluster instance). - Writer Failover
 * Procedure Duration of time running writer failover procedure. - Reader Failover Procedure
 * Duration of time running reader failover procedure.
 *
 * <p>Performance (hit-miss) metrics: - Successful Failover Reconnects A total number of failover
 * events vs a number of successful ones - Used Last Connected Reader Number of time driver utilises
 * details about a last successfully connected reader host. Knowing the last successfully connected
 * reader host helps driver to connect to this host in the first turn rather than trying to randomly
 * connect to any reader hosts. This metric is applicable for read-only connections only. - Invalid
 * Initial Connection As a side-effect of using last connected reader host from a cache, there's a
 * chance that this host may turn out to be a writer, not a reader as expected. In such a case,
 * driver has to drop connection to this host since it's not accurate and initiate a new one to
 * another host. Such cases are measured by this metric. "Hit" event corresponds to dropping
 * connection and connecting to another host. - Used Cached Topology Number of time driver utilises
 * a cached cluster topology
